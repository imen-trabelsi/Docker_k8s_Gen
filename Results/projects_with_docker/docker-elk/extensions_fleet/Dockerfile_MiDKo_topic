# The Dockerfile specified below maximizes efficiency by utilizing a multi-stage build process.
# This approach reduces image size as build dependencies are not included in the final image.

# step 1: build stage
FROM maven:3.8.1-openjdk-11 as build

# creating base directory for the application
RUN mkdir /app

WORKDIR /app

# copying pom.xml file to the docker image
COPY pom.xml .

# downloading all required dependencies
RUN mvn dependency:go-offline -B

# copying source files
COPY src ./src

# building application
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# step 2: package stage
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim as production

EXPOSE 8080

RUN mkdir /app

WORKDIR /app

# copying over the built artifact from the build stage

CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
