# Expose desired port for the app to run
EXPOSE 3000

# The following line should be placed in the Dockerfile if the microservice is listening 
# to 3000 as the primary port. This'll ensure Docker knows that the microservice running 
# on the port provided is healthy.
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:3000 || exit 1

# Execute the application
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]

# This Dockerfile does not address certain topics the user inputted, 
# since there were no values provided (such as specific security considerations, 
# networking details, build arguments, specific run commands, etc). 
# You may want to add these yourself if they are necessary for your specific use-case.
