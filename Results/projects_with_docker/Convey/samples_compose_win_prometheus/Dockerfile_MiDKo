# Considering we have a prometheus based spring boot application to be dockerized, 
# and assuming that the application is already been build as jar file before docker build command runs.
# Hence, the sample Dockerfile for the application could be

# Getting base image
FROM prom/prometheus

# Set the application directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copying configuration files
COPY ./prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
COPY ./app.jar /app/app.jar

# Expose the port on which the application should run
EXPOSE 8080

# Start the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar"]
CMD ["/app/app.jar"]

# Please note that the actual Dockerfile would be a bit more complex depending on 
# several factors like whether the application is spring boot or not, 
# whether the Spring Boot application is a JAR or a WAR, handling logs, runtime configuration, health checks, etc.
# But this snippet should help as a starting point.
