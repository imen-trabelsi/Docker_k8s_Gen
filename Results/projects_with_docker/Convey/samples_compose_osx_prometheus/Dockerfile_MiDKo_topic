# Start with the user provided base image
FROM prom/prometheus

# Set working directory as instructed by the user 
WORKDIR /app

# Copy configuration file from your project to the prometheus directory in the container 
COPY ./prometheus.yml /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml

# Continue your Dockerfile as needed based on your source code, environment settings, 
# security necessities, networking, health checks, and more.

# For instance, if you need to expose a port like 8080, you would include:
# EXPOSE 8080

# And if the entry point should be a particular file, you would include:
# ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","your-jar-file.jar"]

# Or similarly, if you have a run command, you would include:
# CMD ["your-command"]

# Depending on your specifics, your Dockerfile will vary a lot from here. 
# Fill in with appropriate commands and arguments based on your project and environment.
