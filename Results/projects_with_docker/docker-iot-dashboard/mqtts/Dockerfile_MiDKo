# As there is no information available about the Programming Language, Framework, Dependencies, Database, Build System, Configuration Files, Static Files, Security Considerations, Deployment Environment, Networking, Health Checks, Exposed Ports, Build Arguments, Execution Command, Users, Environment variable and labels in the query provided above, we cannot generate a Dockerfile optimized for these inputs. 

# However, based on the user's given Copy instructions and Run commands, and the base image of the Dockerfile as `phusion/baseimage:master-amd64`, here is a simple Dockerfile:

FROM phusion/baseimage:master-amd64

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends software-properties-common && \
    apt-add-repository ppa:mosquitto-dev/mosquitto-ppa && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    certbot \
    mosquitto \
    mosquitto-clients && \

COPY mosquitto.conf /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
COPY mosquitto.sh /etc/service/mosquitto/run

RUN chmod +x /etc/service/mosquitto/run

# Please update the Dockerfile with additional information as per your requirement.
