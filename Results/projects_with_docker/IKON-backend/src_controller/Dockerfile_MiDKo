# Python is mentioned as the programming language, but the user has provided Node.js as the base image. So, it's a bit confusing.
# The following Dockerfile is generated based on the Node.js base image.

# Define base image
FROM node:13.10.1-alpine3.10

# Define working directory and create required directories
WORKDIR /app
RUN mkdir -p /app/frontend
RUN mkdir -p /app/data/nginx/cache

# Install dependencies
RUN apk add git
RUN yarn install --cwd /app/frontend/

# Clone source code and build project
RUN git clone -j4 -b master https://github.com/FUB-HCC/IKON-projektor.git /app/frontend
WORKDIR /app/frontend
RUN yarn build

# Copy files
COPY docker-compose.yml src/controller/Dockerfile /app/
COPY src/controller/src/nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
COPY --from=builder /app/frontend/build/ /usr/local/nginx/html/
