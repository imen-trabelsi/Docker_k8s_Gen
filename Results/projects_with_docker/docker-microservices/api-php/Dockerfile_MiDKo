# Earlier, there was a multi-stage build with Composer but since it's not a multi-stage build then no need of that.

# Note: we'll not be using the COPY instructions for PHP-related configurations and Composer as this is a NodeJs App.  

# Update the repositories and install Node and npm
RUN apk update && apk add --no-cache nodejs npm 

# Create app directory in Docker
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy package.json AND package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install app dependencies
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source. Copy all the rest source code.
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 8000

# Run the app
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
