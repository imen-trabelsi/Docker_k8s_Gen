# Step 1: Base image
FROM openjdk:8u151-jdk as builder

# Step 2: Define the working directory in the docker image
WORKDIR application

# Step 3: Copy maven executable to the image
COPY mvnw .
COPY .mvn .mvn

# Step 4: Copy the project files
COPY pom.xml .

# Step 5: Copy the sources
# Note: It's better to separate com.mands from sources to leverage Docker caching capabilities. It's good for local dev.
COPY src src

# Step 6: Package the application
RUN chmod +x ./mvnw
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests
RUN mkdir -p target/dependency && (cd target/dependency; jar -xf ../*.jar)

# Step 7: Use a smaller base image to reduce the final image size
FROM openjdk:8u151-jdk
COPY startup.sh /usr/bin/startup.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/bin/startup.sh

# Expose the port
EXPOSE 8080

# Set environment variables
# This is usually specified by the user. It might contain database URL, credentials, etc.

# CMD/ENTRYPOINT
CMD ["/usr/bin/startup.sh"]
