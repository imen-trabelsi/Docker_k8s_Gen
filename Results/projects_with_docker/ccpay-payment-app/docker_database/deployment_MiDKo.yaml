Here is a Kubernetes Deployment manifest for the given microservice details:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: unnamed-microservice
  name: unnamed-microservice
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: unnamed-microservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: unnamed-microservice
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: postgres:16.2
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
        name: unnamed-microservice
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: http
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /
            port: http
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
      serviceAccountName: default
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: unnamed-microservice
  name: unnamed-microservice
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
  - port: 5432
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: unnamed-microservice
```

Please note this manifest defines a Kubernetes Deployment and Service. It uses the provided Docker image (`postgres:16.2`) and exposes port 5432. Image pull policy is set to `IfNotPresent`, meaning Kubernetes will not try pulling an image if it already exists locally.

The number of pod replicas is set to 1. Since `ClusterIP` is specified as the service type, the microservice is only reachable within the cluster. If you want to expose this service outside the cluster, you will need to use a different service type (`NodePort` or `LoadBalancer`) or use an Ingress.

This manifest assumes the liveness and readiness probes will reach HTTP GET at the root path (`/`) on the default HTTP port for the container. The service account used for this deployment is the default one.

As no volumes, volume mounts or tolerations are specified, the manifest does not include any.

If the information provided to the function would change (e.g., a different Docker image, different exposed port, different microservice name, etc.), the above manifest would need to be adjusted accordingly.
