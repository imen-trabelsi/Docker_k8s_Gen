Here's the Kubernetes service manifest using the provided information:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: microservice-name
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  ports:
    - port: 5432
      targetPort: 5432
  selector:
    app: microservice-name
```

In this manifest, replace 'microservice-name' with an actual name of your microservice. The `selector` field identifies the set of pods to target, it should be the same value that was used in the deployment manifest as `labels`. So, ensure that the actual microservice deployment has a label `app` with the value of `microservice-name`. 

Note: The `targetPort` could be different if your service is listening on a different port inside the container. You would need to adjust that for your specific setup.
